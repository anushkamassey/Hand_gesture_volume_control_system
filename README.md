# Hand_gesture_volume_control_system
The Hand Gesture Volume Control system uses a webcam and MediaPipe to track your hand. By measuring the distance between your thumb and index finger, it maps this distance to system volume via Pycaw. A visual bar shows the volume level in real time, allowing touchless, intuitive audio control.
